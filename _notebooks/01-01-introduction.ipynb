    "Importantly, MacKay distinguishes between the *analogue* computer and\n",

    "machines. An analogue machine is *literally* an analogue. The radar\n",
    "systems that Wiener and MacKay both worked on were made up of electronic\n",
    "components such as resistors, capacitors, inductors and/or mechanical\n",
    "components such as cams and gears. Together these components could\n",
    "represent a physical system, such as an anti-aircraft gun and a plane.\n",
    "The design of the analogue computer required the engineer to simulate\n",
    "the real world in analogue electronics, using dualities that exist\n",
    "between e.g. mechanical circuits (mass, spring, damper) and electronic\n",
    "circuits (inductor, resistor, capacitor). The analogy between mass and a\n",
    "damper, between spring and a resistor and between capacitor and a damper\n",
    "works because the underlying mathematics is approximated with the same\n",
    "linear system: a second order differential equation. This mathematical\n",

    "This is a quite different from the approach that McCulloch and Pitts\n",
