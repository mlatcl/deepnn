    "One of Breiman’s ideas for improving predictive performance is known as\n",

    "models on the data such that they overfit (high variance). Then average\n",
    "the predictions of these models. The models are trained on different\n",
    "bootstrap samples (Efron, 1979) and their predictions are aggregated\n",
    "giving us the acronym, Bagging. By combining decision trees with\n",
    "bagging, we recover random forests (Breiman, 2001).\n",
    "\n",
    "Bias and variance can also be estimated through Efron’s bootstrap\n",
    "(Efron, 1979), and the traditional view has been that there’s a form of\n",
    "Goldilocks effect, where the best predictions are given by the model\n",
    "that is ‘just right’ for the amount of data available. Not to simple,\n",
    "not too complex. The idea is that bias decreases with increasing model\n",
    "complexity and variance increases with increasing model complexity.\n",
    "Typically plots begin with the Mummy bear on the left (too much bias)\n",
    "end with the Daddy bear on the right (too much variance) and show a dip\n",
    "in the middle where the Baby bear (just) right finds themselves.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Daddy bear is typically positioned at the point where the model can\n",
    "exactly interpolate the data. For a generalized linear model (McCullagh\n",
    "and Nelder, 1989), this is the point at which the number of parameters\n",
    "is equal to the number of data[1].\n",
    "\n",
    "The bias-variance decomposition (**Geman:biasvariance92?**) considers\n",
    "the expected test error for different variations of the *training data*\n",
    "sampled from, $\\mathbb{P}(\\mathbf{ x}, y)$ $$\\begin{align*}\n",

    "$$ and it summarizes error that arises from the model’s inability to\n",
    "represent the underlying complexity of the data. For example, if we were\n",
    "to model the marathon pace of the winning runner from the Olympics by\n",
    "computing the average pace across time, then that model would exhibit\n",
    "*bias* error because the reality of Olympic marathon pace is it is\n",
    "changing (typically getting faster).\n",
    "\n",
    "The variance term is given by $$\n",
    "  \\text{variance}\\left[f^*(\\mathbf{ x})\\right] = \\mathbb{E}\\left[\\left(f^*(\\mathbf{ x}) - \\mathbb{E}\\left[f^*(\\mathbf{ x})\\right]\\right)^2\\right].\n",
    "  $$ The variance term is often described as arising from a model that\n",
    "is too complex, but we must be careful with this idea. Is the model\n",
    "really too complex relative to the real world that generates the data?\n",
    "The real world is a complex place, and it is rare that we are\n",
    "constructing mathematical models that are more complex than the world\n",
    "around us. Rather, the ‘too complex’ refers to ability to estimate the\n",
    "parameters of the model given the data we have. Slight variations in the\n",
